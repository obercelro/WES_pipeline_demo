MissingOutputException in rule multiqc in file /home/visceria/projects/wes/Snakefile, line 194:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/qc/multiqc_report.html
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
